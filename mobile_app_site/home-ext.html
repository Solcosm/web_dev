            <p class="cardLayout">Developers must hold at minimum a Bachelor's degree (preferably in Computer Science or Information Technology) and must have a strong understanding of the programming languages that mobile devices use. Many degrees in this field involve concentrations
                in areas such as data structuring, systems design and general programming. Mastering multiple programming languages is also critical for software development.</p>
            <p class="cardLayout">Many software development positions require applicants to have some form of work experience, usually in the form in internships. These internships allow for novice developers to experience real-world deadlines and programming techniques. They
                also help aid in exposing developers to multi-team development projects and the process of releasing software "into the wild ".</p>

            <p class="cardLayout">Many positions will require a developer to have some kind of certification proving that they are fluent in a certain language or with a certain operating system.</p>
            <p class="cardLayout">There are many certification for the largest OSs and languages. For example, Google has an official <a class="hyperlink" href="https://developers.google.com/training/certification/">Android Developer Certification</a> that you can aquire by
                passing an exam.</p>
            <blockquote>
                Google Developers Certification lets you demonstrate your proficiency and skill. After you pass a certification exam, you can use your certification to promote yourself to the communities, projects, and employers that are important to you. All the certification
                exams are backed by rich training content offered as online curriculum, instructor-led training, or self-study materials. When you pass a certification exam, Google stores your certificate, badge, or other digital mark in a central, verifiable
                location. You can include your digital mark in your email signature and embed it on sites such as LinkedIn and Twitter.
