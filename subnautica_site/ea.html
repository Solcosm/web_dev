            With the release of <em>Natural Selection 2</em> in late 2012, Unknown began research on their next major title. Soon, <em>Subnautica</em> would be released on Steam as an Early Access title on December 16, 2014. The title was chosen to be
            released as Early Access as the initial funding from backers would allow the studio to create a larger and more ambitious game than their previous titles. Support for backers include various perks such as an exclusive in-game pet called the
            Qutefish and a free copy of the games soundtrack. The studio also allows for Early Access players to submit feedback to the development team using an in-game feedback system, follow real time updates of the games development on the studios
            Trello board, and opt-in to an experimental branch of the game that receives multiple daily updates for bug testing and sneak peeks of upcoming features.
