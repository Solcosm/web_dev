            <strong><em>Subnautica</em></strong> is developed by Unknown Worlds Entertainment, an independently owned American game development company based in San Francisco, California. They are a relatively small studio consisting of approximately
            twenty employees. The studio is best known for the <em>Natural Selection</em> series and their most current game, <em>Subnautica</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unknown Worlds was formed in early 2001 by soon to be founder Charlie Cleveland and began development work on their first major project which would later be revealed as the highly popular <em>Half-Life</em> mod: <em>Natural Selection</em>.
            Receiving many accolades from critic sites such as GameSpy, who praised the mod for bringing many intricate RTS elements to the then aging <em>Half-Life</em>, success from <em>Natural Selection</em> drove the team to create a mainline sequel
            to the mod aptly named <em>Natural Selection 2</em>.
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/peeper.png" width="100" alt="subnautica_peeper" class="img"> After major development began on <em>Natural Selection 2</em>, Cleveland officially founded Unknown Worlds Entertainment as a computer games studio. During the development
            phase of <em>Natural Selection 2</em>, Unknown would gain critical members from other development studios, mainly Max McGuire who joined the studio as its co-founder after leaving his previous position as Lead Engine Programmer at Lore Entertainment.
            Unknown would also create and then release a casual Sudoku puzzle game titled <em>Zen of Sudoku</em>. This title was created in tandem with <em>Natural Selection 2</em> to generate funds for the studio. Later into development, the studio would
            announce the switch from the famous Source engine, which was developed by Valve Software for <em>Half-Life</em>, to their own proprietary in-house engine. The studio consulted the fanbase of
            <em>Natural Selection</em> on a possible name for the engine, which was unanimously voted to be titled Evolution. Unfortunately, the name Evolution was already in use by Canadian game development studio Digital Extremes for their own proprietary
            in-house engine. The name was then changed to Spark to avoid unnecessary controversy.
