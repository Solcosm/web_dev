            The player controls the protagonist (dubbed the Lone Survivor) from a first-person perspective. The main objective of the game is to explore the different biomes of Planet 4546b while tending to their health, hunger, thirst, and oxygen meters. Players
            can interact with the environment by gathering resources such as scrap metal and the local flora and fauna. Using these resources, the player can construct food, tools, submersible vehicles, and structures which they can use to create personalized
            bases. The game also features an active day/night cycle which affects the hostility of various sea creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Various game modes are included in the most recent build of the game (April 2017) which include:
