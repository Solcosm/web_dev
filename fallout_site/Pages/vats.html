            <h2>“Sometimes survival requires a little gambling...”</h2>
            <p>
                V.A.T.S. is a core gameplay element that appears in every major installment since
                <em>Fallout 3</em>. Inspired by a similar ability to target an enemies specific body part in
                <em>Fallout </em>and
                <em>Fallout 2</em>, V.A.T.S. acts in a similar fashion for the 3D games – allowing the player to freeze/slow
                down time and target specific areas of the body. V.A.T.S. requires the usage of Action Points (AP) depending
                on the type of weapon being used and the area being targeted. When in the V.A.T.S. menu the player will see
                percentages, which indicate their likeliness to inflict a successful hit, the percentage chance caps out
                at 95% with a permanent 5% chance to miss. Small health meters are displayed over each targetable area which
                display the overall condition of that area with an empty bar meaning the limb is crippled. The bar at the
                top of the screen displays the targets overall health which is useful in determining which shots are worth
                taking.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many V.A.T.S. related perks and skills that the player can choose from depending on the game. Being first introduced
                to the player on their 10
                <sup>th</sup> birthday in Vault 101 (
                <em>Fallout 3</em>), V.A.T.S. becomes an integral part of the 3D games with many expansion perks including:
