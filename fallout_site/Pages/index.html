            <h3 id="summary">“War never changes.”</h3>
            <em>Fallout</em> is a series of post-nuclear apocalypse role-playing video games. Set sometime during the 22nd and
            23rd centuries, the theme of the
            <em>Fallout</em> games relies heavily on the post-cold war culture of 1950s America. Combining the imaginary and
            futuristic technology along with the ever-present looming fear of nuclear annihilation from an all-out war with
            China, the setting is a perfect blend of past and future.
            <br>
            <br> In an alternate reality where the transistor was not invented and vacuum tubes and atomic physics take its place
            as the cornerstones of scientific progress, the world of
            <em>Fallout</em> is destined to be set in a 1950s era culture far into the future. This divergence allows for many
            bizarre technological occurrences such as advanced robotics, nuclear-powered automobiles and energy weapons being
            placed along room sized computers and rotary telephones.
            <br>
            <br> After the self-proclaimed “golden age”, the United States begins to divide into 13 commonwealths which become
            controlled by a group of political conglomerates known as the Enclave. After the Enclave gain control over most
            of the United States, an energy crisis emerged due to depleting petroleum reserves (thanks to all the new technology)
            which leads to the “Resource Wars”. The Resource Wars feature smaller skirmishes which all snowball into the
            “Great War of 2077” which consists of a two-hour nuclear barrage between many major nuclear powers. This war
            devastates the United States and most likely the rest of the world, which gives us the settings that we explore
            in the games.
            <br>
            <br> Knowing that a global scale war was imminent, the United States government began working on a project in 2054
            to construct “Vaults”. There would need to have been around 400,000 vaults constructed to comfortably accommodate
            the population of the United States, although only 122 were constructed before the war. Although these vaults
            were advertised as protection from the bombs and the resulting radiation, they were secretly designed to host
            (mainly unethical) experiments on their dwellers. In three out of the five main titles in the series the player
            begins by exiting a vault which thrusts them into the post-apocalyptic United States wasteland…

            <em>Fallout</em> is the first game in the series and therefore is the oldest. Released in 1997, this isometric RPG
            is known as the spiritual successor to
            <em>Wasteland</em>, the previous post-apocalyptic game that Interplay Productions/Entertainment worked on. The game
            takes many elements from its predecessor and improves upon them, mainly through the introduction of full sprites
            and textured graphics. One of the biggest improvements that was included was the extremely open-ended gameplay
            and clever writing. The protagonist (Vault Dweller) is tasked with retrieving a water chip in the Wasteland which
            will replace the broken one currently in their vault. Once this chip is retrieved the player is caught up in
            thwarting the plans of a group of mutants led by their leader, aptly known as Master.

            <h3 id="fallout2">Fallout 2</h3>
            Released a year later in 1998,
            <em>Fallout 2</em> is the sequel to
            <em>Fallout</em> and boasted many improvements over the original, including an improved engine, many Quality of Life
            tweaks to the companion characters and some combat changes while keeping its isometric perspective. Along with
            these changes the writing and game world were adjusted to include more pop culture jokes and self-parodying references.
            Eighty years after the events of the first game, the protagonist of
            <em>Fallout 2</em> (a descendent of the protagonist of the previous game), known as the Chosen One, must save their
            village from severe droughts and famine. Afterwards the Chosen One must once again save the village from an assault
            by the Enclave.

            <h3 id="fallout3">Fallout 3</h3>
            Spearheaded by Todd Howard and developed by Bethesda Game Studios, known for their work on
            <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, the series saw a revival after a decade in the form of
            <em>Fallout 3</em> which released in 2008. Rather than an isometric perspective with turn-based combat,
            <em>Fallout 3</em> brought the series into the world of First-Person Shooters with real-time combat. This shift into
            a 3D made the open-world style of the previous games along with the world building talent of Bethesda turn the
            game into an instant classic. The protagonist, known as the Lone Wanderer, is forced to leave their home of Vault
            101 after their father mysteriously departs. Once they emerge into the Capital Wasteland, the post-apocalyptic
            remnants of Washington D.C., the player sets off to find their father and discover the mysteries that the bombs
            created.

            <h3 id="falloutnv">Fallout: New Vegas</h3>
            Seen as a spinoff to
            <em>Fallout 3</em> rather than a direct sequel,
            <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> was developed by Obsidian Entertainment which included developers from the first two
            games. Released in 2010, New Vegas uses many of the same assets which were present in
            <em>Fallout 3</em> and includes many new areas, quests, characters, weapons and a new overworld setting of the post-apocalyptic
            Mojave Desert. Due to Obsidian’s lengthy and detailed attention to world building and the lore of the series,
            New Vegas offers the player very detailed, interconnected and rich lore to discover. Having been aided by some
            developers of the original duology the writing in New Vegas features darker humor and tackles more taboo topics.
            The game is set four years after the events in the Capital Wasteland with the protagonist assuming the role of
            a courier who ends up getting shot in the head and left to die in a graveyard before being rescued by the doctor
            of Goodsprings. Once recovered, the courier sets off to find their would-be killer.

            <h3 id="fallout4">Fallout 4</h3>
            Influenced by both
            <em>Fallout 3</em> and
            <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> the team at Bethesda Game Studios released a direct sequel to
            <em>Fallout 3</em>, aptly titled
            <em>Fallout 4</em> in late 2015. Due to their previous work on
            <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> and their shift from the Gamebryo engine (used in
            <em>Fallout 3</em> and
            <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>) to their very own Creation Engine,
            <em>Fallout 4</em> features many technical and graphical improvements over the past games. One of the biggest changes
            was the focus on improving the first-person combat and the introduction of a base building mechanic known as
            ‘Settlements’ where the player can create settlements for survivors in the wasteland. Set a decade after the
            events of
            <em>Fallout 3</em> in 2287, the story begins on the day the Great War began: October 23, 2077. The protagonist, later
            to be known as the Sole Survivor, takes shelter in Vault 111 where they witness the murder of their spouse and
            the kidnapping of their son, Shaun. The Sole Survivor emerges 210 years later after being subject to suspended
            animation to roam the Boston Commonwealth in search of their missing son and to find out who murdered their spouse.
